- 👋 Hi, I’m @raresdiaconu and I have just started my learning journey on The Odin Project. I have previously took the freecodecamp Responsive Web Design course.

- 👀 I’m interested in music, arts, sports and coding!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning frontend development and generally how to be a better and kinder human being.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate ...(?) It might be a bit early for me to know for sure, but I am looking forward to learning how to code and getting better at it.

- 📫 How to reach me ...
